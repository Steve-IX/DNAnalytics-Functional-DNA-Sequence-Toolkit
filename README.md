# DNAnalytics-Functional-DNA-Sequence-Toolkit
DNAnalytics is a Node.js program that shows how far you can go in pure JavaScript without a single loop. It ingests a nucleotide stream, recognises short motifs (even with ambiguous IUPAC codes), counts their occurrences, and pin-points every match â€” all in real time and with fully declarative, array-centric code.
